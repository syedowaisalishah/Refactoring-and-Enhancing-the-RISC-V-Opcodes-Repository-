# Audit Report for `rv_i`

## Summary

This audit report identifies redundancies, inconsistencies, and areas for optimization in the `rv_i` module of the RISC-V opcodes repository. The goal is to improve the clarity, maintainability, and overall usability of the repository.

## 1. Redundancies

- No redundant elements found.

## 2. Inconsistencies

- The format of instructions is mostly consistent, but the naming of immediate values could be more standardized for better readability and maintenance.

## 3. Areas for Optimization

### Standardize Immediate Values

- Ensure consistent naming for immediate values across all instructions (e.g., `imm20`, `jimm20`, `imm12`).

### Add Comments

- Provide comments to explain less obvious parts of the instruction formats.

## Detailed Analysis

| Instruction | Current Format | Suggested Improvements |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| `lui`       | `rd imm20 6..2=0x0D 1..0=3` | Consistent |
| `auipc`     | `rd imm20 6..2=0x05 1..0=3` | Consistent |
| `jal`       | `rd jimm20 6..2=0x1b 1..0=3` | Use `imm20` for consistency |
| `jalr`      | `rd rs1 imm12 14..12=0 6..2=0x19 1..0=3` | Consistent |
| `beq`       | `bimm12hi rs1 rs2 bimm12lo 14..12=0 6..2=0x18 1..0=3` | Use `imm12hi` and `imm12lo` consistently |

## Recommendations

Based on the audit, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Standardize Immediate Value Naming**: Use consistent names for immediate values across all instructions.
2. **Add Comments**: Provide comments to explain less obvious parts of the instruction formats.
3. **Ensure Format Consistency**: Make sure all instructions follow a uniform format for readability and maintenance.

## Expected Outcome

- A refactored and well-documented opcodes repository.
- Automated tools for easier integration and verification of new opcodes.
- Comprehensive audit report detailing the changes made and their rationale.
- Best practices documentation for future contributors.

By addressing these points, the repository will become more consistent, maintainable, and easier to understand for future contributors.
